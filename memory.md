Virtual address space is the maximum amount of address space available to an application, which depends on architecture, e.g. CPU register size. Virtual memory enables each process to have its own unique view of a computer's memory.

Physical memory is a storage hardware, made up of physical memory devices, which is organized as an array of M contiguous byte-sized cells. Each byte has a unique physical address (PA).

Physical memory addresses are unique in the system, virtual memory addresses are unique per-process.

Only the kernel uses physical memory addresses directly. Userspace programs exculsively use virtual addresses. Translation from virtual to physical address needs the combination of OS software, address translation hardware in MMU, and page table stored in physical memory or disk.
